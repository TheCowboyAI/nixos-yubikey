# The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS):
>[PCI DSS](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/standards/pci-dss/) sets forth strict requirements for companies handling cardholder data, including encryption. 

## Data Encryption in Transit and at Rest:
  PCI DSS requires sensitive cardholder data to be encrypted when transmitted over public networks (Requirement 4). This protects data from being intercepted by malicious actors.
  Cardholder data stored at rest must also be rendered unreadable through encryption (Requirement 3.4). This includes techniques like strong cryptography and encryption keys managed securely.

## Strong Cryptography Standards:
  PCI DSS emphasizes using strong encryption algorithms. Examples include AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) and TDES (Triple Data Encryption Standard) with key lengths of at least 128 bits for symmetric encryption.
  It requires following industry best practices, such as the [NIST recommendations](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/57/pt2/r1/final) for cryptographic security.

## Encryption Key Management:
  Secure key management practices are mandatory (Requirement 3.5 and 3.6). Organizations must limit access to encryption keys and use dual-control and split knowledge for key management operations.
  Regular key changes, proper storage, and destruction procedures must also be implemented to safeguard encryption keys.

## PAN (Primary Account Number) Protection:
  The PAN must be masked when displayed, and full PAN data should never be displayed except for users with a specific need.
  Encryption, truncation, tokenization, or hashing are recommended techniques to protect PAN when it's stored.

## Periodic Review and Testing:
  Systems encrypting cardholder data must be regularly tested and validated to ensure they continue to meet PCI DSS requirements.

## Compliance Implications: 
*Non-compliance with PCI DSS can lead to significant penalties*, loss of the ability to process card payments, and increased liability in the event of a data breach. Organizations subject to PCI DSS should continuously monitor and update their encryption practices to maintain compliance.

# Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA):
[HIPAA](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/security/index.html) mandates that covered entities implement technical safeguards to protect electronic protected health information (ePHI). While encryption is an "addressable" implementation specification—meaning it's not strictly required—organizations must assess whether encryption is appropriate for their environment. If not, they must implement equivalent measures to safeguard ePHI. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) provides guidance on implementing the HIPAA Security Rule.

# Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA): 
[GLBA](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/statutes/gramm-leach-bliley-act) mandates financial institutions to protect consumers' personal financial information. The Safeguards Rule under GLBA requires institutions to implement security measures, including encryption, to protect customer data.

# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR):
[GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/), applicable to organizations handling personal data of EU residents, emphasizes data protection by design and by default. While not explicitly mandating encryption, GDPR considers it a suitable measure to ensure data security, especially for sensitive information.
